Files of publication 

In this repo presents an efficient and high sensitivity
RF energy harvesting supply. The harvester consists of a single
series circuit with one double diode on a low-cost, lossy FR4 substrate, 
despite the fact that losses decrease RF harvesting
efficiency. The design targeted minimum reflection coefficient and
maximum rectification efficiency, taking into account not only the
impedance matching network, but also the rectifier microstrip
trace dimensions and the load. The simulated and measured
rectenna efficiency was 28.4% for −20 dBm power input. In
order to increase sensitivity, i.e. ability to harvest energy and
operate at low power density, rectennas were connected in series
configuration (voltage summing), forming rectenna arrays. The
proposed RF harvesting system ability was tested at various input
power levels, various sizes of rectenna arrays, with or without
a commercial boost converter, allowing operation at RF power
density as low as 0.0139 µW/cm2
. It is emphasized that the
boost converter, whenever used, was self-started, without any
additional external energy. The system was tested in supplying a
scatter radio sensor, showing experimentally the effect of input
power density on the operational cold start duration and duty
cycle of the sensor.
